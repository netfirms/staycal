### Core Philosophy: Value-Based Tiering

The foundation of this strategy is to offer a free, valuable entry point to attract users and then provide compelling reasons to upgrade as their business grows. The pricing tiers are based on three key value axes:

1.  **Scale:** The number of rooms and staff users.
2.  **Efficiency:** Features that save time and automate tasks (e.g., iCal sync, notifications).
3.  **Revenue Generation:** Tools that help owners make more money (e.g., direct booking engine).

### Proposed Pricing Tiers

Here is a breakdown of the recommended subscription plans.

#### **1. Free Tier: The Anchor**

The Free tier is the most critical part of the marketing funnel. It's designed to be genuinely useful for the smallest operators, allowing them to experience the core value of the product with minimal friction.

*   **Target Audience:** Hobbyist hosts or owners with 1-2 rental units.
*   **Limits:**
    *   **1 User**
    *   **Up to 2 Rooms**
*   **Core Features:**
    *   Full calendar and booking management.
    *   Conflict detection to prevent double bookings.
    *   Today’s operational dashboard (check-ins/check-outs).
*   **Goal:** Frictionless onboarding and a clear demonstration of the product's core value.

#### **2. Basic Tier: The Workhorse**

This is the primary paid plan for established small businesses. It unlocks features that improve efficiency and provide better business insights.

*   **Target Audience:** Small guesthouses, B&Bs, and homestays.
*   **Limits:**
    *   **Up to 5 Users**
    *   **Up to 10 Rooms**
*   **Features (Everything in Free, plus):**
    *   **Two-Way iCal Sync:** This is the killer feature for this tier. It allows owners to sync their GoStayPro calendar with OTAs like Airbnb and Booking.com, drastically reducing the manual effort of managing availability.
    *   **Basic Reporting:** CSV exports of bookings and simple monthly performance reports.
    *   **Email Support.**
*   **Suggested Pricing:** **฿249/month** or **฿2,490/year** (offering a discount for annual payment is a powerful incentive).

#### **3. Pro Tier: The Powerhouse**

The Pro tier is for larger operators or those who want to maximize their revenue and professionalize their operations.

*   **Target Audience:** Boutique inns, multi-property owners, and professional hosts.
*   **Limits:**
    *   **Unlimited Users & Rooms**
*   **Features (Everything in Basic, plus):**
    *   **Direct Booking Engine:** A simple, embeddable widget that allows guests to book directly from the property's own website, saving the owner from paying high OTA commissions.
    *   **Advanced Analytics:** In-depth reports on Occupancy, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room).
    *   **Automated Guest Notifications:** Automated confirmation and reminder emails to guests.
    *   **Priority Support.**
*   **Suggested Pricing:** **฿699/month** or **฿6,990/year**.

### Additional Revenue Streams: Add-ons

In addition to the core subscription plans, you can offer optional add-ons for a monthly fee. This allows you to capture more revenue from power users without cluttering the main pricing tiers.

*   **SMS/WhatsApp Notifications:** Offer automated booking notifications via text message for a usage-based fee (e.g., a bundle of 100 messages per month).
*   **Branded PDF Reports:** Allow owners to generate professionally branded reports and invoices with their own logo.
*   **Multi-Property Portfolio View:** For owners who manage more than one property, offer a unified dashboard to view aggregated analytics and switch between properties for a flat monthly fee.

### Go-to-Market & Growth Strategy

1.  **Self-Serve First:** The entire user journey, from signing up for the Free plan to upgrading via Stripe, should be self-service. This keeps your operational costs low.
2.  **Content Marketing:** Create blog posts and guides targeting keywords like "homestay booking template," "free B&B calendar," and "how to avoid double bookings on Airbnb." This will drive organic traffic to your landing page.
3.  **Referral Program:** Offer a "give one month, get one month" referral program. When a user refers a friend who becomes a paying customer, both receive a free month of service.
4.  **Partnerships:** Collaborate with local tourism boards and homestay associations to offer group discounts to their members.

By implementing this multi-faceted strategy, you can build a sustainable and profitable business around the GoStayPro application.
